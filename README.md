# Telecom Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

By analyzing various customer attributes like tenure, monthly charges, total charges, type of internet service, and contract duration, we aim to identify patterns that indicate potential churn.

## Highlights
- **Data Analysis**: In-depth exploration of the dataset to understand key factors influencing churn.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilization of advanced analytical techniques to predict customer churn.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, enabling users to input customer data and receive churn predictions instantly.
